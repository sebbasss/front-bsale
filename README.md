Front-end App for Bsale hiring process.

Description:
This APP is written in vanilla JavaScript. It's function is to display the products received from an API, allowing the used to filter them according to the categories and searching for specific products thanks to the search-bar.
Being a Vanilla JS app, the only files are App.js, in charge of making the website dynamic, Index.html, where the structure (or skeleton) of the website is defined, and the Style.css file, where style is given to the website.

Launching the app:
In order to launch the app, you only need to clone this repository on an empty directory, open your prefered code editor, and open the index.html file on the localhost your prefer. In my case, I use Visual Studio code, if that is your case, you just need to right-click on the index.html file, and chose the 'Open with Live Server' option.

I hope you enjoy!
